## Instructor
**Name**: Tan Yan Shuo

**Email**: yanshuo@nus.edu.sg

**Office**: S16 06-112


## Course Description
This course provides an introduction to the analysis of time series data. Time series data is encountered in various fields such as finance, economics, engineering, and environmental sciences. The course covers fundamental concepts, techniques, and models for analyzing and forecasting time series data.

## Course Format and Meeting Times
This course will have a [blended learning](https://cit.nus.edu.sg/blended-learning-2-0-2/) format, which means that half the weekly lecture content will be delivered via online lecture videos.
Students are expected to have viewed and understood the lecture video before coming for in-person class.

**Section 1**: Thursdays 7-8:30pm, LT28


**Section 2**: Tuesdays 7-8:30pm, LT28
